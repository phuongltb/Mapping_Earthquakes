# Mapping_Earthquakes
Visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Overview of the project
Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data. The following will be added to the map:
  - Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
  - Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
  - Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

## Results:
Below is the map of earthquake data, tectonic plate data, and major earthquakes displayed on the map when the page loads. The map is displayed in Streets style by default:

Users can view the map in a different style such as Satelite or Dark. The image below shows the map in Satelite style:

Users can choose which data to be displayed on the map. For example, the image below shows only the major earthquakes data on the map in the dark style:

Each major earthquake data point is displayed as a circle and is poped up to display the magnitude and location of the earthquake as the image below:
